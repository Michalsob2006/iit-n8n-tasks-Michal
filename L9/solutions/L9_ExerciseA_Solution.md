Summary:


I created a new n8n workflow called L9_exerciseA_<Michalsob2006>.

The workflown uses a Webhook to receice an event name from the url.

Then I added a code note that formats the current date and time and builds a message.

Finally, I used a respond to webhook node to return the message as JSON.


I tested the workflow using the test webhook and then activated it to use the production url
